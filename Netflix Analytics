-- SQL code to query a Netflix database. I am answering questions about the data.

-- How many movies are there in the database?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
;

-- When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
;

-- List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order?
 SELECT title
 FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
 ORDER BY title asc
;

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star'
;

-- What is the oldest movies in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 2
;


-- alternative using subquery
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
